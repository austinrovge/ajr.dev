                    <p>This website has some information about me and projects I've worked on, but I mostly use it to try out new web technologies!</p>

            <div>
                <p>I first started programming in middle school when I discovered the <ExternalAnchorTag href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript">Codeacademy course on JavaScript</ExternalAnchorTag>. Within an hour of starting the course, I was proudly showing my mom the basic for loops I made!</p>
                <p>In high school, I joined robotics to help program robots in C++, but I ended up switching gears and helping out with the team's web department. I helped work on <ExternalAnchorTag href="https://atthecontrol.com">At The Control</ExternalAnchorTag>, a streaming service for <ExternalAnchorTag href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc">FIRST Robotics Competition</ExternalAnchorTag> events.</p>
                <p>After graduating from high school, I went to the <ExternalAnchorTag href="https://www.msoe.edu">Milwaukee School of Engineering</ExternalAnchorTag> to major in software engineering. I interned at <ExternalAnchorTag href="https://www.msoe.edu">Direct Supply</ExternalAnchorTag> throughout college and accepted a full time job after graduating.</p>
